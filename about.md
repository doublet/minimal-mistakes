## Studies

I am currently studying [NCMT](http://nmct.be) (New Media and Communication Technology), at [Howest, University College West-Vlaanderen](http://howest.be). I have always been interested in technlogy and web development.

## Interests

I'm interested in the following technlogies, in no particular order:

* Node.js
* Web development
* Scalability
* Operating systems development
* Kernel development


## This website

I have had my slew of blogs and sites on cheap webhosts, but I plan to make this my permanent home on the web. This site is (currently) just plain html generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) using the beautiful [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme. My current host is [Versio](http://versio.be).

## Contact

You can contact me using any of the social platforms I use, links can be found in the side-bar.
